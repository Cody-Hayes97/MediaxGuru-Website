# Beginner-Youtube-Website
I'm new to programming so don't destroy me too much. I've been working on this website for my YouTube channel for a couple weeks. Any input would be greatly appreciated!  

im working on linking every video to a separate web page so it could be viewed in the website, but so far only the top video links to another page (which doesnt have much on it yet) everything else links to youtube

most of the elements with cursor: pointer dont do anything. i made the top bar just to fill space and look prettier (again im a novice)
